# xsMCP

extra-small MCP SDK for quick client/server builds.

## About

> ðŸš§ This project is under active development, stay tuned!

### Why is there this project?

[`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is large](https://pkg-sized.dev/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) and has dependencies on libraries like `zod`, `express`, etc. that you probably don't even want to use.

Like [xsAI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai), xsMCP does not force you to use a particular server or schema library and is very small.

### Roadmap

Our current target is Streamable HTTP Client,
Stdio and Server have lower priority.

### Compatibility

xsMCP v0.1 is targeted to be compatible with the `2025-03-26` revision and is not backward compatible.
