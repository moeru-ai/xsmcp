# Everything MCP Server

Similar to [modelcontextprotocol/servers/src/everything](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything), but reimplemented based on xsMCP.

## Development

```bash
# Server is listening on http://localhost:3001
pnpm -rF @xsmcp/everything start
```
