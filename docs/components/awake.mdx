Hey you, you're finally awake.

It's {new Date().getFullYear()},

and we've been able to [Move on to ESM-only](https://antfu.me/posts/move-on-to-esm-only),

built on [Web Standards](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/web-standard) and [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/)...

No, wait, why are there [CommonJS](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/90), [Zod, AJV and Express](https://pkg-size.dev/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)?

## If you don't want to see that either, then xsMCP is for you.

### Independent implementation

xsMCP does not depend on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, but reimplement with reference to it.

This allows us to significantly reduce the size.

### Client/Server Code Separation

Usually you should only want to use one of them.

If you wish to use both, don't worry, just install them together.

### Modern target, Runtime-agnostic, Schema library-agnostic

xsMCP is built as ES Module for the ESNext target.

We try not to rely on Node.js built-in modules wherever possible, so it works well in the browser, Deno, Bun, and edge runtimes.
