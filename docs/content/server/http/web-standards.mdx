xsMCP HTTP Server uses only Web Standards like [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

They were originally used in the fetch function and consist of basic objects that handle HTTP requests and responses.

In addition to `Request` and `Response`, there are `URL`, `URLSearchParam`, `Headers` and others.

xsMCP HTTP Server uses only Web Standards, which means that xsMCP HTTP Server can run on any runtime that supports them.
