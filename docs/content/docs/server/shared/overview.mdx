`@xsmcp/server-shared` is the basis for all servers and implements a common server architecture.

```package-install
npm i @xsmcp/server-shared
```

You can create a server like this:

```ts
import { createServer } from '@xsmcp/server-shared'

const server = createServer({
  name: 'example-server',
  version: '1.0.0'
})
```

All subsequent content is based on this server.
