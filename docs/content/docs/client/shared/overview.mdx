`@xsmcp/client-shared` is the basis for all clients and implements a common client architecture.

```package-install
npm i @xsmcp/client-shared
```

You can create a client like this:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@xsmcp/client-shared'
import { createHttpTransport } from '@xsmcp/client-http' // [!code highlight]

const client = createClient({
  name: 'example-client',
  version: '1.0.0',
  transport: createHttpTransport({ url: 'http://localhost:3000/mcp' }), // [!code highlight]
})
```

All subsequent content is based on this client.
